Hey everyone, thanks for checking out my site! This is my very first attempt at blogging. I decided to start blogging along with working on GitHub because I felt that keeping tabs on my programming journey would be a great way to track my growth and share some cool ideas. I have recently gained a strong interest in application development, and since I am pretty new to this area a lot of my projects will be geared towards teaching myself how to use various application development tools and technologies. I am also really interested in artificial intelligence so I will try to incorporate that into some of my projects as well.

I created this site using Jekyll and Github Pages, which I had just learned about earlier today. At the moment, I am using the stock 'minima' theme, but as I continue to learn I want to develop my own custom theme and create a unique experience. With that being said, this site will end up going through a lot of changes. If you are interested in learning more about these tools or are feeling ambitious enough to create a blog of your own, here are links to the home pages of [Jekyll][jekyll-docs] and [Github Pages][github-pages].
