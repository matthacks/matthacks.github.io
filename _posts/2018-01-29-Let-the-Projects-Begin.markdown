I am excited to share that I have started working on some new projects! One of the projects I am working on is called “Yo Wassup!”, and it is my very first attempt at creating an iPhone application. It is a simple application that accomplishes one task: populating a text message to a random contact in your phone and setting the message body to “Yo Wassup!”. Over the years I have accumulated so many contacts in my phone, and a lot of them are of people that I do not keep in touch with or even remember. The purpose of this app was to provide a solution to that problem in a unique way. By clicking a button that prepopulates a friendly message to a random person on my phone, I am presented with an opportunity to either reconnect with these forgotten contacts (or keep in touch with the ones I remember) in a way that is difficult to deny. Currently, the app is functional, but I need to work more on making it look better. I am not a designer, but working on this application really inspired me to learn more about user experience and interface design. While browsing around I came across this awesome digital design application called “Sketch”. It is a macOS tool that you can use to create mockups and icons. They were offering a 30-day trial so I decided to try it out today. I watched a couple tutorial videos and then felt bold enough to attempt to create an icon for my app. Was it impressive? Absolutely not, but I sure had a blast starting to learn a new skill. If you want to check out the current state of “Yo Wassup”, you can view it on my GitHub by clicking [here][yowassup-github], and if you want to check out the Sketch homepage you can click [here][sketch-homepage];

Another project that I started up today is a web application that will allow a user to input a string along with several algorithm parameters and then see how many generations it takes a genetic algorithm to produce a match for their string. In a nutshell, genetic algorithms imitate aspects of real life evolution to reach a solution. I find them fascinating and encourage anyone reading this to go check them out. I have been thinking about bringing this project to life for a while. I ended up pulling the trigger on it because I was having so much fun playing around with Sketch that I ended up creating mockups for several pages of the app. I have never made a mockup until today so they are pretty rough, but you have to start somewhere right? You can check out this project on my GitHub by clicking [here][genetic-github].

Feel free to share any thoughts, suggestions, or questions with me. Thanks for reading!
